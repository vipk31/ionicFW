When using CAMERA source, 

Refused to load media from 'blob:http%3A//localhost%3A8000/d62e77b1-8354-4f25-abd2-f0634de5a4f5' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "media-src *".

Add blob to CSP for media src, Chrome bug: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28467789/content-security-policy-object-src-blob
